### Thanks for stopping by. Here's a little bit about myself...

I'm currently a graduate student at **Northeastern University**, pursuing a Master of Science in **Computer Systems Engineering** with a focus on Data Science. I have 2+ years of industry experience as a **Data Engineer** at Infosys, where I specialized in building scalable data pipelines, cloud migrations, and data quality frameworks. I'm passionate about leveraging modern data engineering tools to solve complex problems and drive AI data-driven solutions.
